							<p>The Web Science Institute brings together world-leading interdisciplinary expertise to tackle the most pressing global challenges facing the World Wide Web and wider society today. The institute was officially launched in 2014 and I was tasked with creating the official University website.</p>

							<h2>Details</h2>
							<p>The key elements of the storytelling were the periodic changes that have been recorded across the archaeological site. The historic periods were identified and the key areas of interest pinpointed. Research into available toolkits highlighted StoryMap by Knightlabs as a good starting point. I wireframed a variety of options, eventually settling on a clear, open interaction with side menus allowing for changes to the period and map elements.</p>

							<p>I started discussing the structure of the site with the clients and the purpose of the site. It was seen as the formal web presence of the Institute and therefore a professional appearance was required. The website was to be designed using the University of Southampton CMS â€“ sitepublisher. I therefore started by wireframing with the common components found in the CMS. Presenting these gave the client a clear idea of what was possible with the currently available technology and feedback allowed me to update the wireframes to the desired.</p>
